# python-CLI
A collection of useful python-to-CLI codes.

For example, you can try running directly:

``python py_to_cli.py AverageList average --iterable=[1,2,3,4.5]``

Or you can add the following line into your ``~/.bashrc``:

``alias py2cli='python /path/to/your/py_to_cli.py'``

Now you can use this syntax:

``py2cli AverageList average --iterable=[1,2,3,4.5]``
